## Multi-dimensional Array

### Multiply two given matrices.
Six values ​​are given to the input of the function: 
- first matrix,
- number of rows in the first matrix, 
- number of columns in the first matrix,
- second matrix,
- number of rows in the second matrix, 
- number of columns in the second matrix

___It is guaranteed that the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.___

Example:

    Input: 1st matrix  = {
                  {1, 2, 3}, 
                  {4, 5, 6}
           }, 
           rows_num = 2, 
           col_num = 3,
           2nd matrix = {
                   {7, 8}, 
                   {9, 10},
                   {11, 12}
            }, 
            rows_num = 3, 
            col_num = 2

    Output: a = {
                  {58, 64}, 
                  {139, 154}
            }
